1. Which of the following data structure allows you to insert the elements from both the ends while deletion from only one end?
   1. Output-restricted queue
   2. Input-restricted queue
   3. Priority queue
   4. None of the above
2. Linked lists are best suited 
   1. for the size of the structure and the data in the structure are constantly changing
   2. for relatively permanent collections of data
   3. for both of above situation 
   4. for none of above situation
3. Which of the following is not a limitation of binary search algorithm? 
   1. must use a sorted array
   2. requirement of sorted array is expensive when a lot of insertion and deletions are needed
   3. binary search algorithm is not efficient when the data elements are more than 1000 
   4. there must be a mechanism to access middle element directly
4. The situation when in a linked list START=NULL is 
   1. underflow 
   2. overflow 
   3. housefull 
   4. saturated
5. A binary tree whose every node has either zero or two children is called 
   1. Complete binary tree 
   2. Binary search tree 
   3. None of above
   4. Extended binary tree
6. A parentheses checker program would be best implemented using

   2. Queue
   3. Stack
   4. Any of the above
